# Vision test Game

This is a simple game created using pure JavaScript. \
The objective of the game is to find the square with a different color within a given time limit. \
The game becomes harder as you progress through the levels, and your time limit increases as you make correct choices.

## How to Play

1. Click on the 'Start' button to begin the game.
2. You will have 15 seconds to find the square with a different color.
3. As you progress through the levels, it will become harder to find the different square.
4. Your time limit will increase with each correct choice you make.
5. If you need help, click on the 'Help' button. This will make it easier to recognize the different square, but you will lose 5 seconds of your time.
